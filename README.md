# Spectral and Fuzzy-C-means Clustering
Implementation of the Spectral Clustering(https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/courses/ml14/notes/Luxburg07_tutorial_spectral_clustering.pdf) algorithm using different proximity graphs from scratch and analysis of the effect of tweaking different hyper-parameters on the Iris data set. Using other data sets to demonstrate when the spectral clustering algorithm is useful. 
Also contains implementation of the Fuzzy-C-means algorithm (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0098300484900207) from scratch and application on the iris dataset for classification.
