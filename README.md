# Spectral-Clustering-Fuzzy-C-means-clustering
Implementing the spectral clustering algorithm using different proximity graphs from scratch and analyzing the effect of tweaking different hyper-parameters on the iris data set. Using other data sets to demonstrate when the spectral clustering algorithm is useful. Implementing fuzzy c means from scratch and using it on the iris dataset for classification.
